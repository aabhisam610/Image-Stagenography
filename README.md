# Image-Stagenography
#STEGANOGRAPHY One of the data securing mechanism is steganography, steganography is the practice of hiding a message in a non-secret cover media. It has many methodologies based on the nature of secret message and cover messages. Some examples of steganography are: ~Hiding the message in a text ~hiding the message in a modern digital medium, ex- an image or audio file

#IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY An innocent-looking image is taken as an example and a message is embedded in the image by changing the number of pixels selected by the encryption algorithm. Pixels are the smallest individual element of an image. So, each pixel represents a part of the original image. It means, higher the pixel-higher or much accurate representations of the actual picture.

#BASICS OF PIXELS In a black and white image (not greyscale), black pixel has a value 1 and a white pixel as a value of 0. Whereas in coloured images, they have three main colour components (RGB- Red, Green, Blue), with pixel values of 0-255 for each pixel. So, a pixel of (255, 255, 255) will represent a white and (0,0,0) means black. As the maximum number an 8-bit binary number can represent 255, is the maximum number we can go. As the base of binary-number is 2, we can convert the binary number into decimal very easily.
